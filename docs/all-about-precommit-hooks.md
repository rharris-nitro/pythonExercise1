Exercise 3 is learning about pre-commit hooks. Link: https://medium.com/@anton-k./how-to-set-up-pre-commit-hooks-with-python-2b512290436

Pre-commit hooks are script tests ran before you commit your changes. They check for format and validity.

To setup:

- Make sure you have a local git repository to pre-commit to, for starters
- You want to install pre-commit into the root folder of the git repo with `pip install pre-commit`
- Add a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. You can generate a basic one with `pre-commit sample-config`
- Then install the git hook scripts by going to the repo root folder and entering `pre-commit install`

Now when you commit changes to this repo, checks will run.
OR
If you would like to run the pre-commits before committing you can enter:

```bash
task pre-commit
```

To run a specific hook, enter `pre-commit run <hook-id> --all-files` with `<hook-id>` being the name of the hook.

Recommendations:
Here are some basic hooks, linters, and formatters to make everything look pretty.
None are necessary but all are useful. (Also revs may vary)
