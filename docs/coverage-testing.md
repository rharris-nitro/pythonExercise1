# Coverage Testing

Coverage testing is a method used to measure the extent to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs. A program with high coverage has been more thoroughly tested and has a lower chance of containing software bugs than a program with low coverage. See more

## Setting Up Coverage Testing

To set up coverage testing in your project, follow these steps:

### Install Coverage Tool:

First, you need to install a coverage tool. For Python projects, coverage.py is a popular choice. You can install it using pip:

```bash
   pip install coverage
```

### Configure Coverage:

Create a pyproject.toml file in your project's root directory to configure coverage settings. This file allows you to specify which files should be included or excluded from coverage reports, among other settings. Here's a basic example:

```bash
    [tool.coverage.run]
    omit = [
        "/usr/local/*",
        ]

    [tool.coverage.report]
    exclude_lines = [
        "pragma: no cover",
        "if __name__ == '__main__':",
        ]
```

This configuration tells coverage to include all files in the app directory except those in tests and migrations. It also excludes lines marked with `# pragma: no cover` and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

### Run Coverage:

To run coverage tests, use the coverage run command followed by the command to run your tests. For example, if you're using pytest, you would run:

```bash
   coverage run -m pytest
```

This command runs your tests under coverage and collects data on which parts of your code were executed.

### Generate Report:

After running your tests, generate a coverage report using the coverage report command. This will display a report in the terminal showing the percentage of code covered by tests.

```bash
   coverage report
```

For a more detailed report, you can use coverage html to generate an HTML report, which you can view in your web browser.

```bash
   coverage html
```

## Integrating Coverage Testing into Your Workflow

To ensure that coverage testing is an integral part of your development process, consider integrating it into your continuous integration (CI) pipeline. This way, coverage reports are automatically generated and reviewed whenever changes are pushed to your repository.
